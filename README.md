# Projeto_Front-end_3 - REACT🏁

## 🏘️ TOWN HOUSE !

### 🇬🇧 en
Final project for the third module (ReactJS and TypeScript) at Kenzie Academy Brasil

#### Goals
It is an application with the purpose of helping syndics to more easily manage the day-to-day in the condominiums. With it, you can post notices that are visible to all residents, respond to or create requests/complaints (if you are a syndic or resident), reserve common spaces in the condominium (such as grill, pool and saloon) and delete residents (if you are a syndic).

#### Main issues
- REACT and TypeScript
- Creating FakeAPI with json.server
- Routes with react-router-dom
- Protected routes with ContextAPI
- Styling with Styled-components, Material UI and others
